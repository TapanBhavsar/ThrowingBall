# ThrowingBall

This Learning project is about implementation of kalman filter to predict throwing ball trajectory.
The implementation currently working in c++ with clean code as ROS package.

This package contains two Nodes:
  1. sensor_data_node
  2. kalman_filter_node
  
After implementation of Kalman Filter the visualization of trajectory will be displayed on Rviz.

Currently, Implementation of above two nodes has been completed. atlast the visualization part on Rviz is still on hold.
